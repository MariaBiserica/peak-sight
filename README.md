PeakSight: Digital Image Quality Assessment and Editing
Welcome to PeakSight, a digital image quality assessment and editing platform. This repository serves as a hub for accessing both the frontend and backend components of the project. By leveraging machine learning and advanced no-reference image quality assessment (NR-IQA) algorithms, PeakSight evaluates and enhances image quality across various platforms.

## Project Objectives
PeakSight aims to provide comprehensive tools for:

- [Quality Assessment]: Analyzes general and specific image features like brightness, contrast, noise, clarity, and color fidelity using NR-IQA methods.
- [Batch Processing and Classification]: Evaluates large image sets, ranks them based on quality, and facilitates efficient sorting and filtering.
- [Interactive Image Editing]: Suggests real-time adjustments and optimizations based on quality metrics, offering features like noise reduction, contrast enhancement, and color correction.

## REPOSITORIES
- [Frontend] (https://github.com/MariaBiserica/License-UI): Built with Flutter, the frontend provides a responsive interface for cross-platform support. Integrated with Firebase, it ensures real-time data synchronization, secure authentication, and interactive editing capabilities.
- [Backend] (https://github.com/MariaBiserica/license-image-processing): Developed in Python using Flask, the backend employs VGG16 and NR-IQA algorithms (BRISQUE, NIQE, IL-NIQE) to provide objective quality assessments and actionable insights for image enhancement.

## Key Features
- Real-Time Quality Scoring: Leverages machine learning to deliver detailed image assessments.
- Scalable Batch Processing: Processes and ranks large volumes of images with ease.
- Seamless Firebase Integration: Supports secure data management, notifications, and offline access.
- Comprehensive Editing Tools: Offers a range of filters, adjustments, and transformations to optimize image quality interactively.
